# Engineering-103-Final
This is an arduino pattern matching game. You will select a difficulty level where a max score to beat is set. The arduino will show a color, and then give you 3 seconds to match it. If you get it correct it will add another color and so on until either you get it wrong, or you beat the difficulty level selected.
